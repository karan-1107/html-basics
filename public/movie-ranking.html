<h1>Karan Kewal Sharma's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of my favouite movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Avengers (part 1)</h3>
<p>This is the movie that introduced me to MCU. I watched the first part in Hindi, that was pretty funny.</p>
<h3>Undisputed 3</h3>
<p>I have a lot of childhood memories attched to this movie when i used to watch this movie in 11th and 12th class. Although looking back, maybe I should have studied more instead of watching it more than 10 times.</p>
<h3>V For Vendetta</h3>
<p>The dialogue and concept of the movie is awesome. Specially the line, "Ideas are bullet-proof"</p>
